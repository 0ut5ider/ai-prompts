The implementation plan should include instructions that have enough detail that this converstaion is not needed to fully implement the bug fix. The plan needs to stand on it's own as it will be passed to a new agent to execute.
Make sure you adjust the unit tests in the tests folder to keep with the unit test methodology. First create the unit test then create the code to pass the unit test.

Separate the plan into distinct phases. Each phase should implement one individual function. 

Write the plan to a md file and place it in the plans/ folder. If folder doesn't exist, create it.
- if the plan is for a bug fix, start the filename with "bug_fix" followed by a slug description of the plan.
- if the plan is for a new feature, start the filename with "feature" followed by a slug description of the plan.
Do not write any code. Do not start implementing the plan.
