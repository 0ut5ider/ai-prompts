## Project Notes

The thinking-partener.md is an opencode agent (separate mode). AGENTS.md is the base config for opencode. Adrian intentionally layered them for this conversation but the intended architecture is AGENTS.md as base, thinking-partner as a separate activatable mode. The key design challenge: extract the universally-useful anti-sycophancy techniques from the thinking partner into AGENTS.md's relationship section, while keeping the thinking partner as a distinct mode for pure reasoning sessions. Need to resolve the action-vs-interrogation conflict by making AGENTS.md context-sensitive about when to act vs. question.
